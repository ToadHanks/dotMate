Project Description
-------------------
Following program is a mini Menstrual Guide. This program
reads from a text file, which contains most searched
queries of this topic, and uses user input to find the 
necessary information. User can interact with the program 
by typing statements. The primary audience of this program
is ill-informed individuals who want to explore more about 
female menstruation. However, please note that everyone and 
anyone is open to use it as they please.Then there is a 
Calendar tool, which user can users get their next period. It 
allows prompts as well, and will guideyou accordingly. 

Motivation
-----------
I grew up in a very female-dominated household with male to 
female ratio, 8:3. Being in this kind of family, yet not 
knowing what Period is until I got out of high school felt 
little insane to me. We're Living in the 21st century, yet
Menstruation is still treated as taboo. There is zero 
initiative given to this topic. Men don't want to hear 
about it, women don't want to talk about it. That's why 
there are many men who are often ill-informed of this topic. 

By making this program, I wanted to encourage conversation 
with 52% of our world population- Women.

Prerequisites
-------------
A GCC or G++ console support

Assembling the Files
--------------------
Place Period.h, CalendarIO.h, Menstrual_Guide.h, Log_IO.h
header files, along with their associated implemenation 
files (*.cpp) files into one folder. Next place 
Menstrual_archive.txt, users.txt and main.cpp in that folder also.

Getting Started
---------------
1) Please read bullet Navigation at the bottom first.

2) When using a compiler:  
    (a) Open a new project, upload the header files in the Header 
     Files section. Place their implementation files in the
     Source Files section.    
    (b) Add the driver file main.cpp in the Source 
     files section.  
    (c) Hit run or compile & run.  
    
3) When using a terminal:  
    (a) Open the terminal. "cd" to where you believe files are.  
    (b) Type "ls" to locate the files. See if Period.cpp, 
      Menstrual_Guide.cpp, Calendar_IO.cpp, Log_IO.cpp and 
      main.cpp are in the directory, if not please
      place them in a directory. Repeat the step.  
    (c) Then use "g++ -c *.cpp -o dotMate_Test" then press enter.  
    (d) Then "./dotMate_Test", hit enter.  
    (e) Program will execute.  
    
    
Running the program
-------------------
This program is purposefuly designed to not have any
selection menu. So, every interaction between you and the
program should be genuine. The program interaction is
very simple. For instance, if you want to say "what is a
Period?" Or say, "can a womans period change?!"
Then you would type that, entirely, no special format 
is needed. You may make a spelling error, or accidenently 
hit number,and misplace a punctuation. Or, you may put many 
spaces. Fret not, this program can handle these types of 
user errors. However, please not that excesssive
spelling erros does lead to bad answers. It is advised to
double check what you want to ask. Your input matters.

Where your input is needed in an exact manner, the program 
would tell you. Or it would react in an obvious way which
you weren't expecting. In these casses, unfortunately,
you can only do, what's being asked from you.

Moreover, if you would like to see next period day, say 
"Hey! I want to calculate my next period?" Or, you can say
"I am planning a vacation with my wife so....?" When you
type these type of phrases, the program will prompt you for 
information and in the end it will make you a calendar 
which you can modify, print and plan your family vacation/ 
resort trip according to what your relative and you see fit. 

When you're done & want close the program, you can simply 
close it,or can type, "Exit the program! Bye!" And the
program will close.
